Pep, a lightweight plugin for kinetic drag on mobile/desktop.

Pep was built out of a need for kinetic drag support for both mobile and desktop devices (click & drag). It uses the best of jQuery's animate functions along with CSS3 animations to bring full-blown kinetic drag that works on all HTML5-ready devices. 

Pep has built-in support for custom start, stop, and drag events, a debugger, and the ability to custom your own kinetic easing functions from <a href='http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/'>Metthew Lein's Ceaser</a>.

Instruction to come.
